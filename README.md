# Sorted Stacked List
**Module 5 Assignment**

This Java program implements a sorted stacked list that efficiently organizes a collection of integer numbers. It begins by reading a sequence of integers from user input via a scanner. As the numbers are entered, they are dynamically sorted and stored in a stacked list, ensuring that the integers are arranged from smallest to largest. This approach not only facilitates easy access to the sorted data but also showcases the program's ability to handle input dynamically, maintaining order throughout the process.
